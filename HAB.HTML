                    <h2>Incredible Hot Air Ballon Tours In Sri Lanka</h2>
                    <p>A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft made up of a bag containing heated air called an envelope. A gondola or wicker basket is suspended beneath, carrying passengers and a source of heat, usually an open flame created by burning liquid propane. Because the hot air inside the envelope has a lower density than the colder air outside, it is buoyant. Hot air balloons, like other aircraft, are limited to flying within the atmosphere. Because the air inside the envelope is about the same pressure as the surrounding air, the envelope does not need to be sealed at the bottom. The envelope of modern sport balloons is usually composed of nylon fabric, while the balloon's entrance is made of a fire-resistant material like Nomex. Modern balloons come in a variety of designs, including rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, although the conventional shape is still employed for the majority of non-commercial and commercial activities.<br>
                        <br>
                        Explore the skies of Sri Lanka, taking in the sights and sounds from above. Float smoothly over the treetops, wildlife, lakes and rivers, cultural sites, local urban homesteads, and landmarks like Sigiriya Rock, at heights of 500 to 2000 feet on average. Sunrise rides are available at daybreak to enhance the experience by combining the sights and sounds of morning with a fantastic experience.
                        Hot air ballooning is a relatively new pastime. Imagine gliding effortlessly over Sri Lanka's breathtaking landscape.
                        Because of its peaceful and predictable character, Dambulla – Kandalama is ideal for flying balloons.
                        The adventure takes on a whole new meaning as the multi-coloured hot-air balloon hovers gently above the woodland.
