                            <h2> Spices</h2>
                            <p>Spices have long been prized in Sri Lanka. Cinnamon which is endemic to Sri Lanka is the most well-known. Spice and ivory dealers from all over the world who arrived in Sri Lanka in the 15th and 16th centuries carried their local cuisines with them, resulting in a wide diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice is cooked in stock with a particular curry and frikkadels, then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-inspired Sri Lankan meal. Sweets from the Netherlands and Portugal are still popular. Roast beef and roast chicken are examples of British influence. The influence of Indian cooking methods and cuisine has significantly impacted what Srilanka has today.</p>
                            <p>Some examples of Sri Lankan Spices:</p>

                         <h2>Culture</h2>
                         <p>Sri Lankan culture has been influenced by a variety of forces, but it
                          has managed to retain many of its old characteristics.Its ancient history
                          and Buddhist tradition have largely affected it. The country has a long and
                          illustrious artistic legacy that includes music, dance, and visual arts. Cuisine,
                              festivals, and sports all reflect the Sri Lankan way of life. South Indian influences
                          can be seen in a variety of ways. The Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British all had a hand
                          in colonizing the area. Cricket, food, holistic medicine, religious icons like the Buddhist flag,
                          and cultural exports like tea, cinnamon, and gems are all well-known in Sri Lankan culture. The culture
                          of Sri Lanka is diverse,as it differs from region to region.</p>
